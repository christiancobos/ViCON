# ViCON ‚Äì Configurable Vision and Communication System over FPGA

**ViCON** (Visual Control over FPGA) is a real-time embedded system designed for camera data acquisition, processing, and communication using a FT245 parallel interface. The system integrates a PC graphical interface, an FPGA core connected to a **MT9V111 image sensor**, and a USB FT245 module to enable seamless video data exchange and control.

This project was developed as part of a Master's Thesis under the **Master in Electronic Systems for Intelligent Environments (MSEEI)** at the **University of M√°laga**, supervised by **Prof. Mart√≠n Gonz√°lez Garc√≠a**.

## üß≠ System Architecture

ViCON implements a bidirectional communication pipeline between a PC and an FPGA. The FPGA captures image data from the **MT9V111 CMOS sensor**, processes or buffers it, and transmits it over USB using an **FTDI FT245 FIFO** module. A **Qt-based GUI** on the host PC allows interactive control and visualization.

## üß© Key Components

### FPGA (Artix-7 on Basis 3 Board)
- **MT9V111 Interface**: Parallel video input.
- **FT245 RX/TX Modules**: VHDL blocks managing USB read/write via FTDI's protocol.
- **Synchronous FIFO**: Buffers incoming or outgoing data streams.
- **Priority FSM**: Controls read/write arbitration, as well as data acquisition from the camera module.
- **Top-level Integration**: Coordinates image sensor input and PC-side streaming via FT245.

### PC Software (C++/Qt + OpenCV)
- Real-time video display from the FPGA over USB.
- Control buttons for enabling/disabling face detection and face recognition.
- List of faces detected.
- FTDI D2XX API integration for robust FIFO communication.
- OpenCV API integration for face detection and recognition algorithms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

### Hardware:
- Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (Nexys 2 or Basis III board)
- MT9V111 image sensor module (parallel interface)
- FTDI FT232H USB FIFO module

### Software:
- **Vivado 2019.1+**
- **Qt Creator 6+**
- **OpenCV 4.11.0**
- **FTDI D2XX Drivers** (Windows/Linux)
- **CMake / G++ / MSVC** (for standalone tools)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Build and Launch the GUI
```bash
# In Qt Creator:
Open ViCON_GUI.pro
Configure and build (Release recommended)
Run with FT245 device connected via USB
```
### 2. Program the FPGA
```bash
# Inside Vivado 
Launch Synthesis
Launch Implementation
Generate Bitstream
Open Hardware Manager
Program device
```

The script automatically sets up sources, constraints, and generates the bitstream for the Basis III board.

## üîç Technical Highlights

- Image Input: MT9V111 provides 16-bit parallel (YCbCr) video.
- Transmission Path: Captured frames are transmitted via FT245 TX logic.
- Reception Path: PC commands or control signals can be received via FT245 RX, also performing face detection and recognition on demand according to the user inputs.
- Arbitration FSM: A centralized state machine in the top module governs whether TX or RX is active and camera data capture according to the received information.
- Simulation Suite: Each VHDL module has been simulated with a dedicated testbench and waveform inspection.

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- FPGA & Simulation: Using Vivado and its simulator with exhaustive cases (stalling RXF, TXE toggling, FIFO overflow).
- PC Side Testing: Raw FT245 C++ test programs used to validate FIFO low-level transactions.
- Sensor Interface: MT9V111 output validated by test patterns and signal timing diagrams.
- Timing Analysis: FSM switching stability, and FIFO read/write timing covered.
